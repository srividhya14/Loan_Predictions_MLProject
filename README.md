  <li>Link to the dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset</li>
  <li>Preprocessing and Exploratory data analysis has been performed to remove Null values and fill empty rows.</li>
  <li>The processed dataset is trained and tested using various classification algorithms such as <b> logistic regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Ensemble Classifier , SVM </b> and the best algorithm is chosen using accuracy as a parameter</li>
  <li>Hyperparameter tuning is performed and the final predictions are made using test data.</li></ul>
